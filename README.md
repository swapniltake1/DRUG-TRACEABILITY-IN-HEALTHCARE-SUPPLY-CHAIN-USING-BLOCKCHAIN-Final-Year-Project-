# Project Information 

The goal of a drug traceability system is to track or trace where a drug has been and where it has gone along the drug supply chain, which is critical for public drug security and pharmaceutical company business. Traditional centralized server-client technical solutions have failed to meet expectations in terms of data integrity, privacy, system resilience, and adaptability. For drug traceability, we've proposed a totally new blockchain system. This solution is more secure and scalable than other options currently available. Furthermore, the suggested system can prune its storage effectively, resulting in a robust and useable blockchain storage solution.
